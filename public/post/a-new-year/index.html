<p>This isn&rsquo;t as much as a year in review for 2015, but all the things I look forward to doing in 2016.</p>

<h2 id="2015">2015</h2>

<p>So 2015 was a big year for me. I gave so many talks and got to meet a whole bunch of other speakers. This was definitly a year where I felt like I grew the most as a speaker and developer. If you&rsquo;re looking to become a better speaker or get into being a dev advocate, defintily checkout this talk by <a href="https://twitter.com/r00k">Ben Orenstein</a></p>

<p>I also got to be on a bunch of podcasts, Adventurs In Angular, AngularAir, as well as the Web Platform Podcast. All of which were really fun and felt like a big growth for me personally.</p>

<p>Finally one of the coolest things to happen was being accepted into the Google Developer Experts program.</p>

<p><em>Go figure, I&rsquo;m an expert</em></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s an amazing program, filled with other amazing developers and it&rsquo;s quite an honour to be a part of.</p>

<h2 id="2016">2016</h2>

<p>Now while 2015 was great, 2016 is shaping up to be an even better year with big changes to my life.</p>

<h4 id="i-m-moving">I&rsquo;m moving</h4>

<p>As much as I love Rhode Island, I am moving out west to the Bay Area. This is something that I thought would be pretty easy for me but is turning out to be really hard. Rhode Island has been the only home I&rsquo;ve known so it&rsquo;s hard for to leave, but it&rsquo;s something I feel like I need to do. No apartment yet, but will be heading out soon to find one and eventually start my new life out there.</p>

<h3 id="more-speaking">More Speaking</h3>

<p>As busy as last year was with conferences, this year is already shaping up to be just as busy. I head out the California to go apartment hunting, then on my way back, I make a quick stop in Utah for Phonegap Day. There&rsquo;s a whole bunch of conferences going on as well, plus some other GDE related events that I&rsquo;ll be attending so life will be very busy, but I&rsquo;ll love every bit of it.</p>

<h3 id="more-open-source">More Open Source</h3>

<p>While working for Ionic, I get to participate in open source every day. While that may seem to be enogh for some, I really want to step up my contribution to any open source project. Whether it&rsquo;s helping out with issues, making PRs, or even helping fund the development, like I currently do for NeoVim. I just want to do more for this community</p>

<h3 id="more-time-for-myself">More Time for myself</h3>

<p>Open source if great and very rewarding&hellip;. but very exhausting. Now this seem very contradictory to what I said before, but I want to spend more time away from my laptop. Since I&rsquo;ll be out in California, maybe plan for a few days away, with no phone or anything, but just to hangout and do some rock climbing. Who knows, but at least something to enjoy MY time. I have this fear of burning out way to early in life and never being able to contribute as much as I could.</p>

<p>So that&rsquo;s all for now. It is the weekend so, time to close the laptop and enjoy the Sun</p>
