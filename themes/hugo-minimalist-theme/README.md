# Minimalist

Minimalist is a responsive theme with a focus on blogging based on the [Minimalistic](Minimalistic) Ghost theme made by [Raphael Riegger](https://github.com/rriegger) . Noteworthy features of this Hugo theme are the integration of a comment-system powered by Disqus, easy localization (l10n), support for RSS feeds, syntax highlighting for source code and sharing options in the blog posts.

## Installation

Inside the folder of your Hugo site run:

    $ mkdir themes
    $ cd themes
    $ git clone https://github.com/digitalcraftsman/hugo-minimalist-theme.git

For more information read the official [setup guide](//gohugo.io/overview/installing/) of Hugo.

### The config file

Take a look inside the [`exampleSite`](https://github.com/digitalcraftsman/hugo-minimalist-theme/tree/master/exampleSite) folder of this theme. You'll find a file called [`config.toml`](https://github.com/digitalcraftsman/hugo-minimalist-theme/blob/master/exampleSite/config.toml).

To use it, copy the [`config.toml`](https://github.com/digitalcraftsman/hugo-minimalist-theme/blob/master/exampleSite/config.toml) in the root folder of your Hugo site. Play around with the settings to tweak your site as you like.


## Localization (l10n)

Localization allows you to easily translate all strings in our website. Within [`exampleSite/data`](https://github.com/digitalcraftsman/hugo-minimalist-theme/tree/master/exampleSite/data) you'll find a file called [`l10n.toml`](https://github.com/digitalcraftsman/hugo-minimalist-theme/blob/master/exampleSite/data/l10n.toml). If you're not blogging in English replace all strings with their equivalents of your preferred language.


## Nearly finished

In order to see your site in action, run Hugo's built-in local server.

    $ hugo server -w

Now enter [`localhost:1313`](http://localhost:1313) in the address bar of your browser.
