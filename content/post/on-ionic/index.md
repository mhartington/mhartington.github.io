This is a post I have wanted to write for a while now, but have been trying to find the right time to do so. With friends still working at Ionic/OutSystems, I do not want to bring any negative attention to them and the work they do. But let's go over what it's like working for a fun startup, building cool shit, and then having a large company acquire you.

## The Nervous Excitement

After working at Ionic for the most part of my professional career, I was privy to the knowledge that Ionic was going to be acquired. I had never going through the process before, so my first reaction was "Oh, cool! What does this mean for me and my team?". After all of the build up and growing of the company, it felt like a weight had been lifted as we weren't in the startup grind. Not that we ever were ever in a serious grind-mode, but being part of a lean company means you don't always get the luxury of taking things slowly and working with all the resources you need.

Once the news finally broke to the rest of the company, we were all a bit skeptical, we were a startup and they were a large enterprise. Definitely some culture clashing there. But, we were told that for the most part we'd be treated as a separate company, with leadership connecting with OutSystems leaders. I met with my counterparts and while we approached things differently, they were good people trying to do help their community. We discuss potential collaboration initiatives but ended up with the idea that we wanted to reach different people. I thought that was the end of it and I'd eventually reach out again maybe every quarter and once a year for budget reviews.

## Run Pulls

The first big thing that came up as a red flag was that the person who coordinated the acquisition was no longer with OutSystems. This should have raised more concern, but we were told that it didn't change anything and in fact was a positive. Again, having never been through this process before I had no idea why this should have been more to be concerned about. Imagine having someone who was always on your side and wanted to keep you as a well funded startup and then one day they're no longer there.
