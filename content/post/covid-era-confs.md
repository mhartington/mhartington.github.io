This past week I got to speak at my first two in person conferences since February 2020. Right around the end of February 2020, I was in Atlanta, speaking at DevNexus, acting as if everything was normal. A pandemic was the furthest thing from anyone's mind. Then March hit and the world went into lock down. Conferences either candled all plans or moved to online events. And while online events would be an "ok" alternative, it was just never the same.

Being someone who was used to traveling and attending events at least once a month, 2020 (and most of 2021) was a big change. But as time went on....and on...and on...the desire for an in person event became real. I didn't just want to go to one, I needed to. I missed seeing people. I missed getting to talk to new people. I missed being on stage and getting the chance to present. Admittedly this is very selfish, but I had hoped that people would get vaccinated, things would open up, and the world would start to get back on track.

Now while _some_ people got vaccinated (good on you), not everyone has and this has lead to the continuing of the pandemic. But people still wanted to have in person events. Could this even happen? How could you pull this off while prioritizing people's safety.

## Conf 1: RenderATL

RenderAtl was hosted in Atlanta,GA at the Gather Spot. Since the venue was already "members only", the organizers must have felt comfortable hosting the event there. It was also fully rented out, so only conference attendees and staff would be there. Upon arriving, attendees, staff, and speakers would all receive a rapid-test. This was in addition to requiring everyone to also be vaccinated. Masks were required at all times, with speakers being allow to remove them while on stage presenting. This was a great experience and it made me feel super safe about attending.

Overall, Render was a great start off to what a covid-era conference could be.
