Earlier this morning I saw a discussion around the value of being "famous" and how that relates to developer relations all together. One side argued that devrel's goal is help people and shouldn't focus on gaining internet "fame". The other argued that being internet famous is almost required and should be what devrel folks aim for. So is it more important to help people, or be well known in the community?

I mean...you want both, right? One is clearly more important than the other (spoiler alert, it's more important to help people), but can do help folks without having some sort of "fame" or notoriety?

I started off my devrel career pretty much a nobody. I was still pretty new to being a developer but through a lot of luck (and privilege), I've gotten to be pretty well known in my circle (Angular, JavaScript, Mobile Apps) all while helping people. But what if I took away any notoriety I've gotten? Well, I'd still be helping people, all be it on a much smaller scale. Even at the start of my career, I was just someone on the main Ionic forum answering questions and helping people build with Ionic. I wasn't focused on gaining more twitter followers, giving conference talks, or even becoming "famous". I wanted to help people.

But as things progress, fame and notoriety are bound to happen. It can be drastic, like gaining thousands of followers in a short time, or slowly building up your following over years. You could end up with 500 followers, 1000, 10K, or even more. But you still have a goal in mind, helping and empowering others. If you didn't have that, what good is the fame? Sure everyone knows you, but you can't really have one-on-ones with them. You can't work through a problem with them
